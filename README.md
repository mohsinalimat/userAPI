## Architecture

The application is separated between three concerns:
- ViewControllers and Views: as UserListViewController, manages the view, its data and interactions.
- Models: as User, manages data relative to models.
- Controllers: as UsersController, manages interactions between the API/the model.

## Libraries

- Alamofire: for network requests. Easily configurable and easy to use.
- AlamofireImage: to handle image downloading easily.
- Reaml: to store local data efficiently and easily.

## Challenge

- Time was the most challenging part of this test.

## Completion

75%. I will need around 30-45mins to improve UI and implement local storage.

## Specs for android

I do not have much knowledge to do android app.
